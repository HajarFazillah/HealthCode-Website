		<h1>What Is Mental Health?</h2><br>
		<h3>You don't have to struggle in silence and it's perfectly fine to seek help.</h1><br>
		<p>
		Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and behave. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. These conditions deeply impact day-to-day living and may also affect the ability to relate to others. If you have — or think you might have — a mental illness, the first thing you must know is that you are not alone. Mental health conditions are far more common than you think, mainly because people don’t like to, or are scared to, talk about them. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of a mental disorder. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.<br><br>A mental health condition isn’t the result of one event. Research suggests multiple, linking causes. Genetics, environment and lifestyle influence whether someone develops a mental health condition. A stressful job or home life makes some people more susceptible, as do traumatic life events. Biochemical processes and circuits and basic brain structure may play a role, too.<br><br>None of this means that you’re broken or that you, or your family, did something “wrong.” Mental illness is no one’s fault. And for many people, recovery — including meaningful roles in social life, school and work — is possible, especially when you start treatment early and play a strong role in your own recovery process.

		<h1>Why Is This Important?</h2><br>
		<h3>Mental health is just as important as physical health.</h1><br>
		<p>
		Emotional and mental health is important because it’s a vital part of your life and impacts your thoughts, behaviors and emotions. Being healthy emotionally can promote productivity and effectiveness in activities like work, school or caregiving. It plays an important part in the health of your relationships, and allows you to adapt to changes in your life and cope with adversity.
		</p><br>
		<h3>How can you improve your emotional health day-to-day?</h1><br>
		<p>
		There are steps you can take to improve your mental health everyday. Small things like exercising, eating a balanced and healthy meals, opening up to other people in your life, taking a break when you need to, remembering something you are grateful for and getting a good night’s sleep, can be helpful in boosting your emotional health.
